# Weather App
Built with React and Redux

## How it works
This app shows the user a weather forcast for their desired city within the united states. The user enters the city in the seach bar and the chart section displays a graphed 5 day forcast for that city. Multiple cities can be entered. 

### Getting Started
1. Checkout this repo and clone it
2. Install the dependencies with npm 
3. Run npm start

If you're not familiar with git you can download a zip file of the project and extract the contents, cd into the project from your terminal, and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.

### Some thoughts on the project
With more time I'd like to possibly allow users to search for cities outside the USA and also add a footer section that links to social media platforms or other related sites of interest. I like the fact that the app does not feel clutered but there a few more UI touches that could have been added like a menu option for a user to look at past forecasts and a suitable footer. I'd also implment some tests specific to the Chart.js and SearchBar.js components.
